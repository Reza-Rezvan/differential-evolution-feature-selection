# differential-evolution-feature-selection
differential evolution algorithm for feature selection
main code is SimpleDE.py and you can run the code. 
Differential evolutionary algorithm include Target vector, Denor vector and Trial vector.
Target vector is our first data or our parents, after we generate Donor vector from Target vector, we generate Trial vector(donor vector is for generate Trial vector), then we use fitness to select best answer between Trial vector and Target vector.
